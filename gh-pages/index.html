<h3>Game Description</h3>
<p>
Space Marine Game is a parody on modern games, just as this website is a parody on ancient websites. The game follows the adventures of a Space Marine through various missions as he rids the
galaxy of whatever happens to be in front of him. But wait! There's more! This game also offers novel methods of user interaction. While movement will be controlled through normal, on screen
controls, other aspects of the game play will depend of the your phone's sensors. Do you prefer to do your space-fighting on the ceiling? Well, just activate your conveniently pocket-sized
gravity well generator and turn your phone upside down! Don't want to waste your resources fighting of some of the more easily frightened enemies? Then just start yelling at your phone to scare
them (and any one watching you) away! Wondering what the weather is like on the all pink planet of Aprilia? Just take a look outside! That's right, your phone will grab your local weather
and stick that in the game! Need some help with a tricky level? Bring in a friend with the networked multiplayer support! What more could you ask for in a game?
